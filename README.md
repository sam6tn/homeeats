This is Uber for those who want to eat homemade food. People who cook at home should be able to create a profile and list the food they cook (with ingredients). They can list themselves available or unavailable. If they are available, their food should be orderable. The cook should get notifications about new orders and have the ability to mark orders as, “received”, “being cooked”, “on the way”, ...etc. The customer who orders food should have a profile and should specify the address where they need the food delivered. Customers can rate the cook and each individual food item in the order. Customers should be able to review the cook rating before ordering and read about individual food items.
