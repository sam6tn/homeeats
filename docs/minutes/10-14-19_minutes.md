Presented the wireframes to the customer to give an overview of the functionalities and navigation through the site that we intend to build. <br/>

Customer's feedback on the wireframes:
- cook will need a scanned form of ID <br/>
- Need to add a settings icon to the customer/cook page so that they can edit their profile <br/>
- Pending orders --> should have two buttons: accept and reject. There should be a countdown timer for when the cook needs to make a decision <br/>
-   Timer needs to be set by admin <br/>
- Want to see everything that the customer ordered and have the price transaction <br/>
- Create a wirefram from order user page <br/>
- Need a checkout cart that can hold the multiple orders <br/>
    -   An order can only have meals from one specific chef <br/>
- Customer can only review a dish if they've ordered that dish before <br/>
- Cook toggle for online/offline on all pages --> add this to base.html <br/>
