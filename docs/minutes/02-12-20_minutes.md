Met with customer to go over final desired requirements and show the current site progress. 

- Showed current site layout from the customer and cook perspective (place and order, as well as showing the new countdown timer) 

Asked about Remaining Requirements
- Messaging system back and forth (once order has been placed)
- Reports Generation
- Specified time frame for accepting orders (not needed anymore since cook can manually accept/reject)
- View online vs offline time (per week)
- Cook statistics report
