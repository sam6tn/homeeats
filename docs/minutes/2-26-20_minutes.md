Meeting Minutes 2/26/20

We implemented messaging - not that good right now but working on it 

Can you please after the name put either customer or cook in parenthesis so it is clear which screen they are viewing (for customers or for cooks)

Admin can see all the revenue by timestamp 

What is the revenue? Doesn’t include tip and driving fee. Shows the 20% HomeEats get. He wants to see this in more detail —> food cost this much, tax this much, tip this much delivery cost this much…logical way displayed that me as an Admin can view as a story. Last two columns can be total revenue for the cook and total revenue for HomeEats. 

We’ll add this to the cook site as well.
