Second meeting with the client to review system requirements. 
- The purpose of this meeting was to present our minimum, optional, and desired requirements to the client (in the form of user stories).
- The client seemed pretty pleased with our requirements thus far and sent us a follow up email with a few more feature details he would like to see in the product, mainly from the admin perspective
- We told our client that we would have the wireframes ready for the next bi-weekly meeting with him (with key screens being logging in, creating an account, browsing dishes, and processing orders)
