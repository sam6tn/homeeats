This is the third part of your first team task on GitHub

First, make sure you are in your branch labeled with your computing ID, not in the master branch.

Override THIS LINE (yes, this one that you are reading right now) with you computing ID followed by a fun fact about you!

#### This line should stay in the file and nothing should be changed in the section below

After you override the line #5, you should commit it and create a pull request.

The White Team is going to grade this activity as part of your Sprint 1 goals.

Good luck!

P.S. If you have questions, don't hesitate to post on Piazza or ask for help!
